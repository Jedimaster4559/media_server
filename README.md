# Home Media Server
Some quick background on what this project is and why I created it. This isn't your typical media server
application. I don't have a lot of photos/videos that I want to have visible accross my network. Essentially,
I wanted this media server to function as a custom implementation of a smart tv, without using an actual
smart tv. As a result, this application contains a bunch of setup scripts to configure an ubuntu environment
to have a bunch of helpful links to popular streaming services and anything else that I may want to watch.

# Pre-Requisites:
Before you can run this application, you will want to have the following things installed:

Required:
- A system running Ubuntu with Gnome as your desktop environment
- Unified Remote Server (Used for controlling the server from your phone).

Suggested:
- SSH (Really helpful if you ever need to debug things, as that can be tough with Unified Remote)

# Future of this project.
The core features of this project are currently still being implemented.

Phase 1:
- Links to and desktop shortcuts for popular streaming services:
  - Spotify
  - Disney Plus
  - Hulu
  - Netflix
  - Youtube

Phase 2 (May not be needed depending on success of phase 1):
- Custom Desktop Implementation
